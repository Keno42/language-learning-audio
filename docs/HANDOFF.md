# Handoff note — audiolesson

_Last updated 2026-09-18 (session 3: auto mode, fixed length)._ Keep this current: whoever picks the
project up next, human or AI, should be able to continue from here without
re-deriving decisions._

## Status: working end to end

`audiolesson generate` plans a lesson from a curriculum + learner state,
writes a timed script/plan/transcript, renders audio through a pluggable TTS
layer, and updates the learner model. 45 unit tests pass
(`python -m unittest`). A 10-lesson simulated course on the sample French
curriculum behaves as intended (new items reactivated at expanding gaps,
reviews interleaved, dialogues and recombination appear once material is
known, lesson ends on today's items).

Verified in this session:
- `stub` and `espeak` providers, WAV + MP3 output (ffmpeg), exact pauses.
- `edge` provider code is complete but **untested**: the sandbox proxy
  refused the websocket (HTTP 403). Test it first thing on a normal network:
  `pip install edge-tts && audiolesson generate ... -p profiles/edge-fr-en.toml -m 3`.
- `openai` and `say` providers are straightforward but also untested here.

## Session 3 additions

- **Auto feedback mode** (`generate --auto`, persisted): unreported lessons
  count as "all good"; pace steps up once every 3 lessons (`AUTO_STEP_EVERY`)
  while the backlog is small; `report --failed` still slows it.
- **Fixed lesson length**: (1) `LearnerState.speech_calibration` — per-language
  measured/planned ratio, multiplicative update with weight 0.7, fed into
  `Timing.speech_ratio`; (2) planner second review pass
  (`PlanConfig.max_review_passes`) when material runs out; (3) renderer
  `fit`: one pause scale factor clamped to 0.85–1.25 to hit `target_seconds`.
  Verified with espeak: 30:00 exactly from lesson 5, pause scale ≈ 1.00 once
  calibrated. Lessons 1–4 are content-bound and short by design.
- The closing reserve is now `8 + 14 s × new items` instead of 12% of the
  budget, and short lessons (< 5 min) can still introduce an item.
- Planner-side estimates are only as good as the last calibration; switching
  provider or voices means one or two lessons of re-calibration (the fit
  factor absorbs most of it, so the file length is still right).

## Session 2 additions

- **Adaptive pace** (`LearnerState.suggest_pace`): new items per lesson move
  within 3–10 from the learner's `report` feedback and the due backlog; it
  never rises without feedback. Rules and rationale are in README "Daily
  routine and pacing". `report` with no ids means "all good" and defaults to
  the latest lesson.
- **Scheduler bug fixed**: intervals used to multiply on every touch, so a
  daily learner hit 100 000-day intervals in two weeks (found by simulating
  the routine, `tools/daily.sh` × 40 days). Now only a review at/after its
  due date grows the interval, capped at 180 days.
- **First lessons are short on purpose**: extra new items beyond the pace are
  limited to +2; the CLI prints a note. Review-only lessons (curriculum
  exhausted) also end early rather than drilling twice.
- **Icelandic starter curriculum** `curricula/is-en-a1.toml` (61 items):
  written by an AI with care for case forms after *fá* (accusative) and
  *Hvar er* (nominative), **not reviewed by a native speaker**. Have someone
  read it before relying on it, especially `súpu`/`samloku`, `án sykurs`,
  `Gætirðu talað hægar?`, `stoppistöðin`. edge-tts voices:
  is-IS-GudrunNeural / is-IS-GunnarNeural (`profiles/edge-is-en.toml`).
- **Content is now the bottleneck.** At pace 6 the 61 items last ~9 days. A
  three-month course needs ~450–500 items; the planner and pacing need no
  change for that, only more `[[items]]` and dialogues in the same style
  (see docs/CURRICULUM.md "Languages with cases").

## Decisions (and why)

- **Python 3.11+, zero required deps.** Curricula in TOML via stdlib
  `tomllib`; audio via `wave`; ffmpeg only for mp3/decoding non-WAV TTS.
- **Three-stage pipeline with a serialized script in the middle**
  (`script.json`) so voices/pauses/providers can change without re-planning.
- **Presumed success.** Audio can't hear the learner; every retrieval counts
  as a success, `report --failed` corrects afterwards. Simplest honest model.
- **Ladder per item kind** (`stages.py`) rather than one global ladder; stages
  an item can't support are skipped, not faked.
- **Slot fills are verbatim vocab `target`s.** No morphology engine. Tag
  discipline in the curriculum keeps generated sentences grammatical
  (that is why `les toilettes` became a phrase, not a `place` vocab).
- **Instructor phrasing in `prompts/<lang>.toml`**, not in code, so a
  Japanese-speaking learner gets a Japanese instructor by translating one
  file (ja provided).

## Known gaps / next steps, in priority order

1. **Test `edge` provider on a real network** (see above). If edge-tts's
   `rate="+N%"` sounds off for slow renditions, clamp `slow_rate` to ~0.8.
2. **Listen to a real lesson and tune timing.** Numbers in `Timing` are
   reasoned defaults, not listened-to ones. Likely tweaks: `between_exercises`,
   `repeat_factor`, the A1 multiplier.
3. ~~`alternatives` never spoken~~ — done: at meaning+ stages, once per
   lesson per item, 50% chance: "You could also say:" + alternative.
4. **Lesson-1 intro bunching.** With nothing to review, the first lesson opens
   with 2–3 introductions in a row (nothing else exists yet). Acceptable but a
   short "listen to this conversation" opener (like Pimsleur) would be nicer.
5. **Dialogue partner translation** is always narrated (`--no-translate` to
   disable). Could become level-dependent (off from A2).
6. **Curricula.** `fr-en-a1.toml` and its Japanese-instructor twin
   `fr-ja-a1.toml` (generated by `tools/derive_fr_ja.py` from a translation
   table; a test asserts the ids stay in sync). The Japanese strings were
   written by an AI, not reviewed by a native speaker — read them once.
   Numbers/plurals are deliberately absent (no morphology). Other target
   languages need a new curriculum file; no code changes.
7. ~~Cross-lesson dialogue difficulty~~ — done: a dialogue plays
   `dialogue_first_turns` (2) turns on first encounter and one more turn each
   later time, replayed without pauses once it is complete.
8. ~~Parallel TTS~~ — done: providers flagged `parallel` (edge, openai) are
   warmed into the cache with `workers` threads (profile key, default 4).
   Untested against a real network, like the providers themselves.
9. **Wheel install** verified to include `audiolesson/phrasing/*.toml`.

## Where things are

See README "Layout". The planner loop is `Planner.build` in
`audiolesson/planner.py` (branches 1–5 are commented). Exercise shapes are in
`audiolesson/exercises.py`. Pause math is `Timing.answer_pause`.

## How to check your change

```sh
python -m unittest -v
python - <<'EOF2'
# ten-lesson simulation: one line per lesson, letters = exercise kinds
# o opening, i intro, r recall, g generative, d dialogue, c closing
